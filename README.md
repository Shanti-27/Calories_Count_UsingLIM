# Calories_Count_UsingLIM

Our project involves the development of a web application using Gemini Pro Vision, a large image model, combined with Streamlit and Google's Generative AI technology. The core functionality of our application is to analyze images of dishes and estimate their calorie content. The application is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, with the ability to process various image formats such as JPG, PNG, and JPEG.

# **Gemini Pro Vision Overview**
Gemini Pro Vision is an advanced large image model that we have pre-trained to recognize and analyze food images. This model forms the backbone of our application, enabling accurate and reliable calorie estimations based on the input images.

# **Development Process**

1. **Creating and Cloning the Repository:** We initiated our project by setting up a new GitHub repository and cloning it to our local system. This step was crucial for establishing a collaborative and version-controlled workspace.

2. **Working in Visual Studio Code:** All development work was conducted in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a versatile code editor supporting numerous programming languages and tools, facilitating an efficient development process.

3. **Creating a Virtual Environment (venv):** We used a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies, ensuring consistency and isolation from other Python projects.

4. **File Functions:**

a. .env: Contains environment-specific variables, crucial for maintaining security and functionality.
b. .gitignore: Lists files and directories to be ignored by Git, safeguarding sensitive data from public exposure.
c. app.py: The main Python file where the application's logic and features are implemented.

5. **Explaining app.py Code:** The app.py file encapsulates the logic for the calorie counting feature, integrating various libraries and methodologies.

6. **Activating the Virtual Environment:** We activated the virtual environment to work with the project-specific Python setup, crucial for managing dependencies.

7. **Using Google Makesuit API:** This API was utilized for its capabilities in data processing and analysis, enhancing our application's functionality.

8. **Installing Dependencies with requirements.txt:** We ensured that all necessary Python packages were installed using the requirements.txt file.

9. **Running the Application with Streamlit and Git Operations:** We launched the application using Streamlit and maintained our codebase through regular Git operations.

# **Short Information on Gemini Pro Vision**
Gemini Pro Vision is a sophisticated large image model used for image recognition and analysis. In our project, it plays a pivotal role in accurately identifying food items in images and estimating their calorie content. The model's advanced algorithms and pre-training on diverse datasets enable it to deliver precise and reliable results.

# **Streamlit Web Application**
Our Streamlit web application is designed to accept image inputs in JPG, PNG, and JPEG formats. Users can easily upload images of dishes, and the application, powered by Gemini Pro Vision, processes these images to provide calorie estimates. The application's interface is intuitive, allowing for seamless user interaction and customization based on individual requirements.

In summary, our project leverages the power of Gemini Pro Vision, Streamlit, and Google's Generative AI to create a user-friendly web application for estimating the calorie content of food items based on image inputs. Each step in the development process, from setting up the environment to deploying the application, has been carefully executed to ensure optimal performance and user experience.
